    "Detection at Multiple Levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of predicting objects directly on a single scale, YOLO V3 makes predictions at different levels of \n",
    "the feature pyramid. This allows the model to detect both small and large objects effectively.\n",
    "Use of Anchor Boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO V3 utilizes anchor boxes similar to YOLO V2, but with different anchor box configurations for each scale.\n",

    "Feature Concatenation:\n",

    "Prediction Heads for Each Scale:\n",
